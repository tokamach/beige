	Abstract = {<p>In a system supporting parallel execution, speculative processing can be used to increase the amount of parallelism. The authors propose a speculative execution scheme for the data-driven Lisp machine BIDDLE. Execution priorities are assigned to instructions according to their nested position in conditional statements. These priorities are updated dynamically during execution as results of Boolean guards of conditional execution are returned. The authors describe the ways to maintain the environment and handle side effects and tuplespace in the speculative context. Each speculative branch is given a separate environment. Any side-effects made are merged into the environment of the calling instruction when the speculation is confirmed, and removed if they are unwanted. It is also demonstrated that infinite data structures can be supported by this scheme.<<ETX>></p>},

	Abstract = {Every operating system embodies a collection of design decisions. Many of the decisions behind today's most popular operating systems have remained unchanged, even as hardware and software have evolved. Operating systems form the foundation of almost every software stack, so inadequacies in present systems have a pervasive impact. This paper describes the efforts of the Singularity project to re-examine these design choices in light of advances in programming languages and verification tools. Singularity systems incorporate three key architectural features: software-isolated processes for protection of programs and system services, contract-based channels for communication, and manifest-based programs for verification of system properties. We describe this foundation in detail and sketch the ongoing research in experimental systems that build upon it.},

@article{SchoeberlMartin2010Nrgc,
	Abstract = {<p><p>A real-time garbage collector has to fulfill two basic properties: ensure that programs with bounded allocation rates do not run out of memory and provide short blocking times. Even for incremental garbage collectors, two major sources of blocking exist, namely, root scanning and heap compaction. Finding root nodes of an object graph is an integral part of tracing garbage collectors and cannot be circumvented. Heap compaction is necessary to avoid probably unbounded heap fragmentation, which in turn would lead to unacceptably high memory consumption. In this article, we propose solutions to both issues.</p> <p>Thread stacks are local to a thread, and root scanning, therefore, only needs to be atomic with respect to the thread whose stack is scanned. This fact can be utilized by either blocking only the thread whose stack is scanned, or by delegating the responsibility for root scanning to the application threads. The latter solution eliminates blocking due to root scanning completely. The impact of this solution on the execution time of a garbage collector is shown for two different variants of such a root scanning algorithm.</p> <p>During heap compaction, objects are copied. Copying is usually performed atomically to avoid interference with application threads, which could render the state of an object inconsistent. Copying of large objects and especially large arrays introduces long blocking times that are unacceptable for real-time systems. In this article, an interruptible copy unit is presented that implements nonblocking object copy. The unit can be interrupted after a single word move.</p> <p>We evaluate a real-time garbage collector that uses the proposed techniques on a Java processor. With this garbage collector, it is possible to run high-priority hard real-time tasks at 10 kHz parallel to the garbage collection task on a 100 MHz system.</p></p>},

@article{KaliberaTomas2011Srgc,
	Abstract = {<p><p>Managed languages such as Java and C# are increasingly being considered for hard real-time applications because of their productivity and software engineering advantages. Automatic memory management, or garbage collection, is a key enabler for robust, reusable libraries, yet remains a challenge for analysis and implementation of real-time execution environments. This article comprehensively compares leading approaches to hard real-time garbage collection. There are many design decisions involved in selecting a real-time garbage collection algorithm. For time-based garbage collectors on uniprocessors one must choose whether to use <i>periodic</i>, <i>slack-based</i> or <i>hybrid</i> scheduling. A significant impediment to valid experimental comparison of such choices is that commercial implementations use completely different proprietary infrastructures. We present Minuteman, a framework for experimenting with real-time collection algorithms in the context of a high-performance execution environment for real-time Java. We provide the first comparison of the approaches, both experimentally using realistic workloads, and analytically in terms of schedulability.</p></p>},
